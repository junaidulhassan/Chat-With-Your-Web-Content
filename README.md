# Chat-With-Your-Web-Content

## Application Name: "WEB-PILOT"

"WEB-PILOT" is a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application designed to interact seamlessly with website content, including vlogs and other materials. This application allows users to paste the URL of any website they want to engage with, enabling question-answering, summarization, and more, all with ease. 

### Key Components

- **Mistral-7b-instruct v0.3 LLM**: Utilized for text generation.
- **Langchain Library**: Used for prompt engineering and developing the RAG application.
- **Chroma DB**: Employed as a vector database for storing data.
- **Transformer Embedding**: Ensures quick document search within the database.
- **Streamlit**: Provides a user-friendly front end to display responses effectively.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we leverage the Mistral-7b-instruct model alongside the Langchain framework. The technique applied here is RAG, focusing on contextual training of LLMs rather than traditional fine-tuning.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

### What is RAG?
Retrieval Augmented Generation is a technique that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by providing contextual training, as opposed to the traditional method of fine-tuning. 

### Advantages of RAG
- **Contextual Training**: Provides more relevant and accurate responses by incorporating external data.
- **Flexibility**: Allows the model to adapt to new information without the need for extensive retraining.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time and computational resources required for fine-tuning.

With "WEB-PILOT," users can experience a seamless and efficient way to interact with web content, making it a powerful tool for extracting and summarizing information, answering questions, and more.
